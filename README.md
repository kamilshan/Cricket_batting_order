# 🏏 Cricket Batting Order Decider

*A simple, fun, and fair web app to randomly decide the *batting (or playing) order* for cricket players using alphabets instead of names.

Designed especially for *kids, school matches, and casual cricket games* no arguments, no bias, just spin and play.*

## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 Randomly assigns batting positions (no repeats)
- 🔤 Players choose *alphabets (A–Z)* instead of names
- ⚡ Instant result  no loading, no waiting
- 📱 Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 🔒 No accounts, no sign-ups, no data collection
- 🌐 Works completely offline once loaded

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter the number of players
2. Each player selects a *unique alphabet*
3. Click *Spin & Decide*
4. The app randomly assigns batting positions from 1 to N
5. Every player gets a unique position

All logic runs *entirely in the browser* using JavaScript.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project is intentionally built as a *frontend-only application*.

User Browser | v HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Static Site)

### Why no backend?
- No user accounts
- No stored data
- No shared state between users
- Randomization is local and fair

A backend would be unnecessary over engineering for this problem.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

Inspired by casual cricket games where deciding who bats first always turns into an argument 😄
